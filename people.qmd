### Lindell Bromham

[Professor, Research School of Biology]{.leader-title}

My research focuses on connecting evolutionary processes across all levels of change, from the genome to the biosphere, and developing new ways to answer challenging questions regarding "tempo and mode" (pace and mechanism) of evolutionary change. I use a range of approaches to asking how tempo and mode of molecular evolution is shaped by species characteristics and environment, and how patterns of molecular evolution might affect macroevolutionary patterns and processes. I extend these approaches to studying linguistic diversity, adapting methods from evolutionary biology to study processes of language change at microevolutionary and macroevolutionary scales.

### Marcel Cardillo

[Professor, Research School of Biology]{.leader-title}

I am interested in the past, present and future of biodiversity. I use phylogenetics, model-based biogeography, comparative methods and simulation approaches to reconstruct the historical events and infer the evolutionary processes that have shaped the biodiversity we see today. I'm interested in how evolutionary history has left some species particularly vulnerable to present-day human impacts, and how we can use this understanding to predict and plan for future extinction risk.

### Xia Hua

[Senior Lecturer, Mathematical Sciences Institute]{.leader-title}

In general, I'm interested in developing evolutionary theories through a mathematical modelling approach. Currently, my research focuses on speciation and phylogenetic theory, trying to elucidate the links between molecular evolution and diversification processes. I'm also interested in applying physics to understand macroevolution.

### Ben Scheele

[Lecturer and ARC Future Fellow, Fenner School of Environment & Society]{.leader-title}

I'm interested in patterns and processes underlying species declines and extinctions. This work cuts across taxonomic groups, with an initial focus on frogs and plans to expand to birds and mammals. I also maintain a long-term field-based research program on several endangered species in the Australian Alps. I'm co-hosted by RSB and the Fenner School, and am also a member of the Keogh Lab.

### Alex Skeels

[ARC DECRA Fellow, Research School of Biology]{.leader-title}

I research the ways in which past environmental changes have shaped species diversity across different plant and animal lineages. I am particularly focused on the role of major climatic change, plate tectonics, and orogeny on biotic exchange and diversification in the Indo-Australia region. I use a combination of simulation modeling and phylogenetic comparative methods.

### Jordan Douglas

[Postdoctoral Fellow, Research School of Biology]{.leader-title}

I am interested in the development of phylogenetic methods, including molecular clock and speciation models. Previously I have worked on the evolution of enzymes, protein structures, viruses, and macroevolutionary systems. Currently, I am investigating the environmental and evolutionary drivers of diversification.

### Sam Passmore

[Postdoctoral Fellow, Evolution of Cultural Diversity Initiative]{.leader-title}

I am interested in the application of evolutionary methods to culture, and how cultural change differs from biological evolution. I use phylogenetic and spatio-phylogenetic methods to explore relationships between languages, and explain patterns of cultural diversity, with a particular interest in kinship systems and kinship terminology.
